# Sending Emails With Python
We use the Gmail server to send emails with Python, but the same principles apply to other email services.

We can easily automate email using Python. Sending email with Python is useful when you can send the same email over and over again. This automation can reduce human errors and free up your time!

For example, if you need a list of contacts, you can use Python to create a new report and send it to an email subscriber. Or, if you run a Python program, you can ask Python to send you an email when it's done.

Before you start sending emails with Python, you need to prepare your Google account so that you can connect to Gmail with Python.

- In order to be able to connect to Gmail with Python, you need to create a new app password in your Google account.
To do this, enter the Google account settings at the address <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">myaccount.google.com</a>.
